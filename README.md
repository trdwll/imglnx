# imglnx

__NOTICE: Django 1.11.2 is vulnerable now so don't run this in production unless you update it.__

__imglnx was once a privacy focused image sharing website and this is the version 2.x source code ("src") that's written in Python using Django.__

__The project isn't maintained anymore, but you're more than welcome to continue the development either on a fork etc or you can submit a PR here and I'll probably accept it.__

imglnx consisted of 17462 images uploaded by 158 users so thank all of you users for making imglnx a wonderful project to have been apart of.

imglnx changed ownership from me [@trdwll](https://github.com/trdwll) to a trusted friend on November 20, 2018. It's currently unknown if that friend will revive the project. _(I keep pestering that friend to revive imglnx so who knows what will happen in the future)_


# Why release the src?
Honestly, this was the first project I made with Django and I'm honestly very proud of the project as a whole _(but not the messy src)_. I was also asked on numerous occasions over the years by someone to release the src and I finally decided to. 
I didn't release the src during the production of imglnx due to lack of knowledge in Django and I didn't want to be bashed for my methods etc. :( However, that brings me to a couple points. 

There are some issues with the project:
1. Messy code
2. A potential vulnerability ("vuln", "vulns") with the exif stripping (...)
3. Possibly some other vulns in the project that I'm unaware of _(I haven't looked at the src since the project was in production)_

I've redacted some credentials from the project as a precaution.


# What now?
Since I've now released the src all I ask is don't be a scumbag and steal my work. If you build off of it [send me](https://twitter.com/trdwll) a link to it or better yet [buy me a pizza](https://paypal.me/vuln/15) _(url auto fills to $15, but you can change the amount)_ and still send me a link. At the end of the day I know people will probably steal the project and claim it as their own by removing my name, but whatever. Any donations that I receive will be much appreciated.

You can also see that my TODO.txt file is in the repo, which has well... things that I needed to work on or that I had planned for future releases.
