2.1.3
Misc
- light theme (button at bottom that saves choice in cookies)
Add TOTAL_ON_PAGE to a cookie or session so the user doesn't have to keep setting it
Do shit from the bottom ;)

2.2.0
RSS Feed for the blog
Completely rewrite the API to be a proper API (rest_framework)
- Add full documentation
- Create albums via API
- Bash script to do uploading via terminal
Private Images/Albums
- Actually make images and albums private (via nginx)
-- If private then only allow the owner access
Delete images after x time (if set on upload)
Add image to multiple albums


Not necessarily apart of the todo list, but things that could/should be improved/added.
- when user downloads archive don't let them spam it only do it once every 15 minutes
Check if image exists before requesting the image data to save etc. (send a HEAD request first)
- notify user if capslock is on for register form
style api-keys-table better
strip all special chars from the fname before saving (url upload)
Delete ID of album should show title (swal)

move UpdateProfileView/Dashboard into it's own View for better handling

- request.user.id == user.id on all forms to validate even more (user.id is from where you get the user from the db before setting data)
